## Current tidy data set

### Information
The tidy data set represents the average of each variables for each activity and each subject.

Both the training and the test data sets were used.

### Explanation

#### Overview :

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

#### In detail

* Concatenate columns from subject_test, y_test, X_Test files into a dedicated data set
* Concatenate columns from subject_train, y_train, X_Train files into a dedicated data set
* Add for these 2 data set the column names based on the features.txt file
* For each of these data set, we only keep columns talking about mean and standard deviation
* Add the Subject and the activity column by giving understandable names
* Combine the two data sets into one
* Changing the activity id into labels by reading the activity_labels.txt file and using the library 'arules'
* Use ddply function from plyr library in order to calculate the mean grouped by Subject and activity
* write the newly created tidy data set into a file

### Columns

The data set can be found into this file :
* tidy_dataset.csv

Each row of this data sets represent a subject for a given activity (first two columns).

Every other columns represents the average of each measures for the Subject/Activity.

Here is the list of all available columns :
* Subject : The participant ID
* Activity : The participant activity at the moment of the measures
